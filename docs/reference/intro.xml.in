  <para>
    Tepl is a library that eases the development of
    <ulink url="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView">GtkSourceView</ulink>-based
    text editors and IDEs. Tepl is the acronym for “Text editor product line”.
  </para>

  <para>
    Tepl was previously known as Gtef (GTK+ text editor framework). The project
    has been renamed in June 2017 to have a more beautiful name. The end of Tepl
    is pronounced like “apple”.
  </para>

  <para>
    The Tepl library follows a product line approach (see the book
    <ulink url="https://www.amazon.com/Feature-Oriented-Software-Product-Lines-Implementation/dp/3642375200/">Feature-Oriented
    Software Product Lines: Concepts and Implementation</ulink>).
    Instead of creating one general-purpose text editor or IDE with a plugin
    system, the idea is to create several <emphasis>specialized</emphasis> text
    editors. For example specialized for one programming language, or one
    development platform, or a small group of related languages. By being
    specialized, an application is potentially better at what it does. It
    follows more closely the UNIX philosophy to do only one thing but doing it
    well. And it better follows the GNOME philosophy: writing applications that
    Just Works; when a user opens the text editor for the first time, it should
    work out-of-the-box, without the need to find, install and configure
    plugins. Of course it still makes sense to develop one general-purpose text
    editor for the languages not yet covered by specialized text editors.

  <para>
    Tepl @TEPL_API_VERSION@ depends on GTK+ 3 and GtkSourceView 3.

    <title>pkg-config name</title>
    <para>
      For Tepl @TEPL_API_VERSION@, the pkg-config name is:
      <code>tepl-@TEPL_API_VERSION@</code>
    </para>
    <para>
      To compile a program that uses Tepl @TEPL_API_VERSION@, you
      can for example use the following command:
    </para>
    <para>
      <code>$ gcc hello.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs tepl-@TEPL_API_VERSION@` -o hello</code>
    </para>
