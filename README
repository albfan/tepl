Gtef - GNOME Text Editor Framework
==================================

Gtef is a library that eases the development of GtkSourceView-based text
editors and IDEs. Some of the Gtef code comes from gedit.

https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit/ReusableCode
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/TdiFramework

The final goal is to create a Tabbed Document Interface (TDI) framework
suitable for text editors.

But the first short-term goal is to have a higher-level API to load and save a
file. All the errors would be handled by Gtef, showing GtkInfoBars etc.

Maybe some of the Gtef features will be moved to GtkSourceView when it's
considered more stable. So Gtef can also be seen as an incubator for some
GtkSourceView features.

The Gtef library is free software and is released under the terms of the
GNU Lesser General Public License.

Roadmap
-------

A roadmap is available alongside the GtkSourceView roadmap:
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/RoadMap

Warning - API/ABI stability
---------------------------

The API/ABI is not considered stable at this point. When the 1.0 version will
be released, then Gtef can safely be used. The 1.0 version will hopefully be
released at the same time as GNOME 3.22. After that, each time an API break is
needed in Gtef, the major version will be bumped so that the new version is
parallel-installable with the previous major versions. And that, every 6 months
if needed, to improve the API incrementally. The only supported version is the
latest one, don't expect bug or security fixes to the old major versions.

Dependencies
------------

- GLib >= 2.44
- GTK+ >= 3.20
- GtkSourceView >= 3.21.2
- libxml2 >= 2.5
- uchardet

Since uchardet is a fairly new library, here is the URL:
https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/uchardet/

Installation
------------

Simple install procedure:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  $ make install

See the file 'INSTALL' for more detailed information.

From the Git repository, the 'configure' script and the 'INSTALL' file are not
yet generated, so you need to run 'autogen.sh' instead, which takes the same
arguments as 'configure'.

To build the latest version of Gtef plus its dependencies from Git, Jhbuild can
be used:

    https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Jhbuild

But Gtef doesn't have yet a jhbuild module in one of the modulesets shipped by
jhbuild. So you need to run autogen.sh manually, inside a jhbuild shell, for
example (adjust the prefix):

  $ jhbuild shell
  $ ./autogen.sh --prefix=/path/jhbuild/prefix --disable-Werror --enable-gtk-doc --enable-vala --enable-code-coverage
  $ make
  $ make install
