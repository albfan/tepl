Gtef - GNOME Text Editor Framework
==================================

Gtef is a library that eases the development of GtkSourceView-based text
editors and IDEs. Some of the Gtef code comes from gedit.

https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GtkSourceView/MdiFramework

The final goal is to create an MDI framework suitable for text editors.

But the first short-term goal is to have a higher-level API to load and save a
file. All the errors would be handled by Gtef, showing GtkInfoBars etc.

WARNING: the API/ABI is not considered stable at this point. When the 1.0
version will be released, then Gtef can safely be used. The 1.0 version will
hopefully be released at the same time as GNOME 3.22. After that, each time an
API break is needed in Gtef, the major version will be bumped so that the new
version is parallel-installable with the previous major versions. And that,
every 6 months if needed, to improve the API incrementally. The only supported
version is the latest one, don't expect bug or security fixes to the old major
versions.
