 * @Short_description: Factory base class
 * @Title: AmtkFactory
 *
 * #AmtkFactory is a base class to create #GtkWidget's from #AmtkActionInfo's.
 *
 * A #GtkApplication can be associated so that when a widget is created,
 * gtk_application_set_accels_for_action() is called.
 *
 * Once the widgets are created, an #AmtkFactory should be freed because it has
 * a strong reference to the #GtkApplication.
