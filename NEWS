--------------------------
This is an unstable release leading towards 2.0. The 2.0 stable version will be
released at the same time as GNOME 3.24.

File loading and saving:
* Finish the first usable version of the new GtefFileLoader.
* Use etags instead of mtime.
* GtefFileSaver: do not use an heuristic to know if it's a "save as" operation.
* Add GtefEncoding, a fork of GtkSourceEncoding to suit the needs of the new
  file loader.
* Re-usable code outside of GtkTextView: GtefFileContentLoader and
  GtefEncodingConverter (private classes).
* Various other small improvements.

Various features for text editors:
* Add GtefBuffer:gtef-style-scheme-id property.
* Add gtef_view_select_lines().
* Add gtef_view_goto_line() and gtef_view_goto_line_offset().
* Add gtef_iter_get_line_indentation().
* The GtefInfoBar class has been revamped.

Starting a basic GtkUIManager replacement based on GAction:
* Add gtef_utils_menu_item_set_icon_name()
* Add GtefActionInfo
* Add GtefActionInfoStore
* Note that those classes are a little out of scope for a text editor library.
  I would be happy to move those classes to a better library once the feature
  is finished and well-tested. The classes were added to Gtef for convenience.

Framework:
* Add gtef namespace to GtefBuffer signals and properties to avoid potential
  conflicts with future GtkSourceView versions.
* Add GtefApplication with gtef_application_get_action_info_store().

Documentation:
* Add an intro with the pkg-config name.
* List API breaks.

Misc:
* Improvements to the build system.

News in 1.0.0, 2016-10-26

This is the first version of Gtef.

File loading and saving:
* Save and load file metadata. If GVfs is not available, there is a fallback
  implementation with an XML file (used e.g. on Windows).

Starting the framework:
* GtefBuffer, a subclass of GtkSourceBuffer with additional features.
* GtefView, a subclass of GtkSourceView with additional features.
* GtefTab, contains a GtefView with GtkInfoBars on top.
* GtefInfoBar, a subclass of GtkInfoBar.

Starting code folding:
* GtefGutterRendererFolds, a basic gutter renderer for code folding.
* GtefFoldRegion, a foldable region in a GtkTextBuffer.
